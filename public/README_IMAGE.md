# Profile Image Instructions

To add your profile image:

1. Save your image as `profile.jpg` in this `public` folder
2. Recommended specifications:
   - Square or portrait orientation (1:1 or 3:4 ratio)
   - Minimum 600x600 pixels
   - JPG or PNG format

The image will be displayed as a circular profile picture in the Hero section.
